MARKDOWN_LONG_PARAGRAPHS_EXAMPLE = """
# Introduction to Advanced Concepts

This is the first actual long paragraph. It is specifically written to be
long enough so that readability metrics can be computed without issues.
It uses several sentences and a mix of words for good text analysis.
This paragraph should yield valid Flesch, Kincaid, and Fog scores.

This is the second actual long paragraph. It also has a good length and some complexity.
This helps ensure that readability scores are consistently made as numbers.
More discussion on this topic will be in other sections of this document.
Testing with varied content like this is good for the scoring algorithm validation.

## Detailed Analysis Subsection

Even subsections can have their own detailed paragraphs. This specific one looks into
the details of concepts previously introduced. We are checking that each text part here,
when seen as a paragraph, gets a score. The main goal is to prevent problems
where short text pieces might give null scores when numbers are expected.
